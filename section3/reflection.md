## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
+ Growth mindset and programming are inextricably intertwined. If you are not setting out to expand, refine, or update your skills and knowledge, you'll quickly fall behind. Someone with a growth mindset will inevitably be able to tackle problems of a greater breadth and depth than someone with a static mindset.
+ Accepting failure is a vital part of the growth mindset, and something programmers deal with on a hourly (maybe even by-the-minute) basis. Code fails. That is just part of the normal coding process.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I have the growth mindset in a couple of ways:
+ I love a challenge. Obstacles are something I love overcoming. The mental reward for solving a problem is enormous for me.
+ I love learning new skills and knowledge. This is something that attacted me to programming. There is a nearly infinite number of libraries, languages and tools to learn.
+ I'm happy to get constructive criticism. We're so often blind to flaws/problems with our work -- it's always beneficial to get an outside opinion.

I think the growth mindset has one struggle for me:
+ ASKING FOR HELP. The reward I feel of figuring out a problem means I often try to tackle things independently, even when it would be better for me to seek help. This is something I'm cultivating a better attitude towards.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  An array method is a pre-built function that can be called on an array. One such change would be to modify the array (pop, push, shift, unshift).

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  A loop lets us automatically execute a block of code multiple times. I would use a loop with an array
  if I needed to interact with the contents of the array. If I just needed to execute a block of code
  based on a variable or a static number, I wouldn't need an array.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  Loops let us do boring repetitive tasks automatically. You just need to tell the program how many times
  to perform the task (computers are picky, so you have to also tell it where to start counting and how
  many numbers to count up by).

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  When looping through an array, what are the use cases for having something other than 1 as the incrementer/decrementer? In other words, doing something like this:
  ```javascript
for (i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 5);
  ```
  It seems like you would always want to loop through every element in the array?
